# Negotiated Scope Contract

Scope, the amount of developed features over time, can benegotiated all the time in the devlopment proces. This is done in order not to cut short on quality to reach deadlines.
Scrum teams have this contract by having a "Commitment" to a sprint goal, but different forms are possible.
This contract has not to be very formal. It's just important for both sides (e.g. team and boss) to understand what the goal and contract is. Just sending a note: Do it so will not cut it.
