# Code Stewardship

> CodeStewardship is an alternative to CodeOwnership, emphasizing that code is the team's property, and not the sole province of any one person. A team member is granted stewardship over a piece of code. The steward has primary responsibility for the code's "care and feeding," with input and guidance from the community. The steward normally makes all changes to the code, though trusted members of the team may make changes that the steward is then responsible for vetting.
