# Ubiquitous Language

> Ubiquitous Language: A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.

## Tipps 

* Draw pictures of the physical and conceptual domain and put names and actions on them. These are mostly informal but may contain some aspects of formal software modeling. Even if your team does some formal modeling with UML, you want to avoid any kind of ceremony that will bog down discussions and stifle the creativity of the ultimate Language being sought.
* Create a glossary of terms with simple definitions. List alternative terms including the ones that show promise and the ones that didn't work, and why. As you include definitions you cannot help but develop reusable phrases for the Language because you are forced to write in the language of the domain.
* If you don't like the idea of a glossary, still capture some kind of documentation that includes the informal drawings of important software concepts. Again, the goal here is to force additional language terms and phrases to surface.
* Since only one or a few team members may capture the glossary or other written documents, circle back with the rest of the team to review the resulting phrases. You won't always, if ever, agree on all the captured linguistics, so be agile and ready to edit heavily.

## Activity 

Sit together and create a glossary of your own domain.
