# Acceptance Tests

> Software developers often distinguish acceptance testing by the system provider from acceptance testing by the customer (the user or client) prior to accepting transfer of ownership. In the case of software, acceptance testing performed by the customer is known as user acceptance testing (UAT), end-user testing, site (acceptance) testing, or field (acceptance) testing.

## Acitivity

Write down the acceptance criteria for a button, that gets disabled, while its submitting a form with ajax, in form of bullet points

Afterwards use the Gherkin Syntax.

**Questions**

* How did you feel using Gherkin syntax ? 
* Was it harder to come up with cucumber styled acceptance criteria 
* What are the disadvanteges of using gherkin syntax? 
* How do you act on fast, easy, simple and requirements descriptions alike. Can these be nailed down in cucumber syntax.
