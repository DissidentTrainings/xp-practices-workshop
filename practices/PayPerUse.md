Have revenue as as metric of how good your own product  works.

> Recently our team was asked "If we could measure one thing and one
thing only and report it back to the company what would it be?"
Currently I am on an ECommerce team providing internal systems for
managing and processing orders.
Many ideas were submitted. Mine got no attention in our meeting were
we went over the suggestions.
The other suggestions went like this:
Hours the servers have been up without a problem.
Number of new features delivered on time.
Number of orders successfully processed.
... and a few more on similar lines...
My suggestion was measure how much money or systems earned or saved.
I suggested that this would not be an easy thing to measure (but it
was fair because they don't ask me to write easy code) but would give
a number that is meaningful to people where decisions are made
concerning staffing, equipment, budgets, etc.
