# Informative Workspace

Informative workspaces contain teh most important information related to a specific team visible for evveryone in public. Examples of informative workspaces are: 

* Scrum Boards 
* Impediment Backlogs
* Build Screens

Through highly visible information, that is "written on the wall" teams get new ways to interact with each other and do work faster that would cost more time otherwise. Additionally, the informative workspaces or information radiators create a focus for the things that are important to a team.
