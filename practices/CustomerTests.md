** aka User acceptance testing **

> User acceptance testing (UAT) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user.[2] It is not system testing (ensuring software does not crash and meets documented requirements), but rather is there to ensure that the solution will work for the user i.e. test the user accepts the solution (software vendors often refer to as Beta testing).
