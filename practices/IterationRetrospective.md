# Iteration Retrospective

After a fixed amount of time (or another metric that is accepted by the team, such as no of stories delivered) a software teasm sits together and reflects about this past phase.  

A normal retrospective contains the following phases in a lot of cases. 

* Open The retrospective
* Gather data
* Generate insights
* Decide what to do
* Close the retrospective 

Retrospectives can be used in many levels of the organization and are at the core of a kaizen process that leads to steady and small improvements.
