# System Metaphor

> The “metaphor” is the practice of agile processes most ignored by practitioners. A
metaphor is meant to be agreed upon by all members of a project as a means of simply
explaining the purpose of the project and thus guide the structure of the architecture, thus
it is very important for communication, both among the team and with the client. Since
both customers and developers alike use the metaphor to clarify the project, a good
metaphor should be easily understandable to customers, yet have sufficient content that it
can guide architecture development.
