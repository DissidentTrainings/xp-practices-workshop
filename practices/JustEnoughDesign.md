# Just Enough Design

Small steps in design decisions creates the chance for more decisions defered to a later stage in the development process. You just need enough hard validated design decisions for now and a Idea where it goes to. This is not a replacement for capacity planning and all the magic.

## Warning

Dont forget your architecture.
