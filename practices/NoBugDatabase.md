# No Bug Database

If you just have a small number of bugs, there is no need for a Bug Database. This is known in Scrum as "Zero Bugs".
Fixing Bugs is important, especially in the light of the cost that is for all bugfixing purposes much higher than initial development and hereby a waste of ressources.
The idea is to go pretty extreme in quality and fix bugs as soon as they pop up.
