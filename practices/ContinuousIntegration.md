# Continuous Integration

> Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies with a shared mainline several times a day. It was first named and proposed as part of extreme programming (XP). Its main aim is to prevent integration problems, referred to as "integration hell" in early descriptions of XP. CI can be seen as an intensification of practices of periodic integration advocated by earlier published methods of incremental and iterative software development, such as the Booch method. CI isn't universally accepted as an improvement over frequent integration, so it is important to distinguish between the two as there is disagreement about the virtues of each
