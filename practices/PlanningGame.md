# Planning Game

An organised activity to map out User Stories to future releases.

The main planning process within extreme programming is called the Planning Game. The game is a meeting that occurs once per iteration, typically once a week. The planning process is divided into two parts:

* Release  Planning
* Iteration Planning

The planning game is related to the Scrum Planning I+II but contains writing stories ad-hoc as a process as well (if you want it)
