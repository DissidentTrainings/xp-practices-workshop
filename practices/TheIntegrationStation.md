# The Integration Station

Have one Server, Mobile Phone or Device you deploy to and integrate your repos master to it daily (if not faster). Then use this build. Like really use it.

This way you have all the pain, wich happens at the end of the iteration normally, every day. This leads to fies and improvements of the deployment (You will always be ready!)
