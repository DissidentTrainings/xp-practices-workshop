# Collective Code Ownership

> Collective Ownership encourages everyone to contribute new ideas to all segments of the project. Any developer can change any line of code to add functionality, fix bugs, improve designs or refactor. No one person becomes a bottle neck for changes.
 This is hard to understand at first. It's almost inconceivable that an entire team can be responsible for the system's design. Not having a single chief architect that keeps some visionary flame alive seems like it couldn't possibly work.
